But what happens if I constrain our element's height as well? Something's going to have to give, right, because there's no space left. So let's adjust a couple of things. First of all, let's go ahead and make this back to ten, so the padding will be just ten all around. And the border is kind of looking unseemly, so we'll make it like five, five pixels.
